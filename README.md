Team Abamath

This is a MEAN-stack application designed to keep track of class rosters for Abamath programming classes.  Abamath provides week long coding classes to elementary and middle school student using Python or Scratch.  Through this app parents are given the option to use a PIN system when leaving class to ensure the right student is being taken home by the right adult.  Parents also have the option to get text notifications when their student leaves class. Hello I am Parker, again.
